# Sample Chapter 1

This is chapter one. Some text here...

Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science.

In this Online document we will discuss from getting started with Python to Numerical Methods, Fractals and Chaos, Monte Carlo Simulation, Path Integral method, Signal Processing, Partial Differential Equations, Network and Complex System, Neural Networks, Nature Inspired Computing, Parallel and Distributed Computing, Blockchain, Quantum Computing.


### 1.1 Subtopics

Some text for describing the subtopics. This could include mathematical equation and figures. Some code block can be shown with direct execution. You can use it as templet for documentation and replace this text for your text.

Code block can be organized as:

```python
DFC = pd.DataFrame({"cosa":[1*np.cos(1*np.pi/18*i) for i in range(R)],\
                   "cos2a":[1/2*np.cos(2*np.pi/18*i) for i in range(R)],\
                   "cos3a":[1/4*np.cos(3*np.pi/18*i) for i in range(R)],\
                   "cos4a":[1/8*np.cos(4*np.pi/18*i) for i in range(R)]})
 ```
